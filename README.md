# Mini-Games

This Code is written for several small games (I will keep adding :))

## Random Number Game

- The main purpose of this small game is to create a program that randomly select a number in a range then the user has to guess the number. The User has four chances to guess the number if what he chose is correct then a message will print saying “you guessed right “ otherwise a negative message prints saying “you were wrong“

- Please see below a short discription on a variable being used
```python
"""
for i in range(0,4):
       #The i represents a temporary variable used to store the integer value of the current position in the range of the for loop that only has scope within its for loop
"""
```
